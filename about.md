Nomad Technologies is group of developers and designers working to create foreign language learning tools. We are particularly interested in immersion based learning which mimics the way in which humans learn and in particular children.

This blog is as space to write and expound on some of the problems and findings we face during our work. A large part of our work makes us of general machine learning techniques and human-computer interaction and thus we write on these topics. If you like (or dislike) what you read and want to get in touch please contact us on the relevant links.
